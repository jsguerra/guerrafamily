        <h2>Focused on one branch</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Many members of the Guerra family in Northern Mexico and Southern Texas can trace their origins back to one ancestor, Ignacio Guerra Canamar. Ignacio Guerra Canamar was born in Mexico City on the 6th of November in 1633. Many of his descendants still live in and around the regions where he once lived.</p>
      <p>This website is dedicated to one of those descending branches. In addition to covering the family history of this branch, this website will also cover the a branch of the Loera family which hail from a similar geography and history.</p>
